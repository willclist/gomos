Exerpt of code developed to apply MCMC methods and dimensionality reduction to data acquired from the Global
Ozone Monitoring System (GOMOS). Provides key examples of the benefits of operating in a likelihood-informed subspace by using the local geometry to construct operator weighted proposals for MCMC.
